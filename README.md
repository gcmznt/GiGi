# GiGi

## The grid generator system for semantic developers

Are you tired to write in your templates always the same classes 'column', 'row', 'span' and so on?

Use your semantic class names and give them a structure directly in your css using GiGi, the Grid Generator system for devs

## Install

npm install --save-dev gigi

## Use

Import gigi.scss in your _file.s[ca]ss_

`@import "gigi/gigi"`

if you are using node-sass you can set the include path to use the file
installed by npm, also if you are using gulp-sass or grunt-sass.

`includePaths: ['./node_modules/']`
